# abap-examples

A list of simple SAP ABAP examples.
I mostly wrote these to get some practice for writing basic reports, but if you like what you see, please feel free to use them.

| Program                                            | Description                                                         |
| -------------------------------------------------- | ------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| [Z_SIMPLE_ALV_GRID](./Z_SIMPLE_ALV_GRID.abap)      | Demonstrates using the REUSE_ALV_GRID_DISPLAY function module.      |
| [Z_TCODE_INFO](./Z_TCODE_INFO.abap)                | Report on custom tcodes and their author.                           |
| [Z_LOCKED_USERS](./Z_LOCKED_USERS.abap)            | Uses cl_salv_table to display report of user lock status.           |

**NOTE:** These reports are pretty plug and play, you can copy them into your SAP's SE38 and run them as is. No custom fields, data dictionary entries, or any other install specific config will be present.
