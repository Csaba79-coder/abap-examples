# abap-examples

A list of simple SAP ABAP examples.
I mostly wrote these to get some practice for writing basic reports, but if you like what you see, please feel free to use them.
These have never been tested/used in a live install of SAP ERP, but give it a go, and leave feedback.

| Program                                            | Description                                                         |
| -------------------------------------------------- | ------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| [Z_SIMPLE_ALV_GRID](./Z_SIMPLE_ALV_GRID.abap)      | Demonstrates using the REUSE_ALV_GRID_DISPLAY function module.      |

**NOTE:** These reports are pretty plug and play, you can copy them into your SAP's SE38 and run them as is. No custom fields, data dictionary entries, or any other install specific config will be present.

**NOTE2:** These bad boys may not be entirely free from syntax errors, as I'm writing them in VS Code and using a static ABAP analysis tool before pushing them to GitHub. They shouldn't crash your ERP application server, but what do I know? ðŸ˜…
